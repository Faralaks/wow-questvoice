# QuestVoice - WoW 3.3.5a Addon for Audio Quests Playback

QuestVoice is an add-on for World of Warcraft version 3.3.5a that provides a unique and immersive experience for questing.
With QuestVoice, you can listen to AI-generated voiceovers for almost all quests, making the game feel more like an audiobook
and allowing you to fully immerse yourself in the story. This add-on adds a new dimension to questing, making it easier to
follow the storyline and understand the quest objectives.

QuestVoice is based on the open-source project available at https://github.com/mrthinger/wow-voiceover. By leveraging
cutting-edge natural language processing technology, QuestVoice brings a new level of immersion to World of Warcraft.
